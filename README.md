# Advent of Code Friend

Discord bot for advent of code leaderboards ðŸŽ–

## Commands

### `/register <session_token> <leaderboard_id>`

Sets up the bot to use this leaderboard in the server you run the command in. All `leaderboard` commands in this server will use the token and leaderboard provided to fetch the API.

### `/unregister`

Clears the session token and leaderboard ID being used by this server.

### `/leaderboard [ordering]`

Uses the registered leaderboard ID to fetch the leaderboard and post it. You can specify a custom ordering method.

### `/puzzle [day] [year]`

Posts a link to the latest puzzle (or for a day/year you choose).

### `/daily leaderboard <channel> [time] [ordering]`

Register the bot to send the leaderboard into a channel you specify at a specific time every day (of December). By default it will send at midnight EST. You can also change the ordering used by the leaderboard that's sent.

Note: Registering the same channel twice will override the previous registration.
